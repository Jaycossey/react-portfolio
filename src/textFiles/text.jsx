    about: "When I began programming, I was awoken to a world from my childhood dreams. Bringing back a love for the endless possibilities, video game ideas and technology as a whole. I remembered a story that I could tell through a game, a story as old as time itself. Now, still very much learning every day, I have discovered skills and concepts that will help me truly realise that dream. I started with learning responsive web development. Gaining the foundations to the muscle memory of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Then I moved on to the concepts of computer science as a whole, gaining insight into algorithmic thinking, logical approaches to problems, and planning (which I cannot stress enough). I have experience working both on my own, and within a team, both inside and outside the world of code, though I prefer a collaborative approach. I offer a professional, organised, motivated service for front end development, especially for the weird and wonderful.",
